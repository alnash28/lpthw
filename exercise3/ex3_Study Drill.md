# Exercise 3 Study Drill 

1. Above each line, use the # to write a comment to yourself explaining what the line does. 

2. Remember in Exercise 9 when you started Python? Start Python this way again and, using the above characters 
and what you know, use Python as a calculator.

3. Find something you need to calculate and write a new .py file that does it. 

4. Notice the math seems "wrong"? There are no fractions, only whole numbers. Find out why by reasearching what a "floating point" number is. 

5. Rewrite ex3.py to use floating point numbers so its`s more accurate (hint 2.0 is floating point).
