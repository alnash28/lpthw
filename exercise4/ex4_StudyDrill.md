# Exercise 4 Study Drill 

1. I used 4.0 for space_in_car, but is that neccesary? What happens if its just 4? 

2. Remember that 4.0 is a "float point" number. Find out what that means 
```
A "floating point" number, also called floats, represent real numbers and are written with a decimal point dividing the integer and fractional parts. 

``` 

3. Write comments above each if the variable assignments.

4. Make sure you know what = is (equals) and that it`s making names for things. 

5. Remember that _ is an underscore character. 

6. Try running Python as a calculator like you didb before and use variable names to do your calculations. 
Popular variable names are also i, x, and j.
