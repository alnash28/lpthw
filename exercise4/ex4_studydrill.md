# Exercise 4 Study Drill 

>"When I wrote this program the first time I made a mistake, and Python told me about it like this:"

```python

Traceback (most recent call last):
	File "ex4.py", line 8, in <module> 
	   average_passenger_per_car = car_pool_capacity / passenger
	NameError: name 'car_pool_capacity' is not defined 
	
```

>"Explain this error in your own words. Make sure to use line numbers and explain 
why."

**Als Answer**
>This error has occured due to the  incorrect variable _car_pool_capacity_ being used, which does not exist within this  >script. The correct variable is reference on line 7 as _carpool_capacity_, therefore this script has encounter an error 
>due to the incorrect variable being used. 



1. I used 4.0 for space_in_car, but is that neccesary? What happens if its just 4? 

2. Remember that 4.0 is a "float point" number. Find out what that means 

```
A "floating point" number, also called floats, represent real numbers and 
are written with a decimal point dividing the integer and fractional parts. 

``` 

3. Write comments above each if the variable assignments.

4. Make sure you know what = is (equals) and that it`s making names for things. 

5. Remember that _ is an underscore character. 

6. Try running Python as a calculator like you did before and use variable names to do your calculations. 
Popular variable names are also i, x, and j.
